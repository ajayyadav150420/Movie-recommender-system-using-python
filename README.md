Create a ratings dataframe with average rating and number of ratings
Histograms
Create a matrix that has the user ids on one access and the movie title on another axis. Each cell will then consist of the rating the user gave to that movie.
Choose two movies: starwars, a sci-fi movie. And Liar Liar, a comedy.
Grab the user ratings for those two movies
Clean this by removing NaN values and using a DataFrame instead of a series
Fix filtering out movies that have less than 100 reviews (this value was chosen based off the histogram from earlier).
